# Source Code

Since 15/01/2020, Spotify4Unity is now open source. I originally developed it closed source and hosted the code on Bitbucket and am continuing to develop using the Bitbucket repository. If you wish to see the source online, visit the Bitbucket repo [here](https://bitbucket.org/JoshLmao/spotify4unity) or using the link below
