Spotify4Unity is a plugin which helps you integrate Spotify connectivity into you Unity game/application easily, allowing users to use basic track control functionality to viewing their whole library. This plugin relies heavily on JohnnyCrazy's [SpotifyAPI-NET](https://github.com/JohnnyCrazy/SpotifyAPI-NET)
