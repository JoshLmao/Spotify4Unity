## About

Spotify4Unity helps to add [JohnnyCrazy's](https://github.com/JohnnyCrazy) [SpotifyAPI.NET](https://github.com/JohnnyCrazy/SpotifyAPI-NET) library into Unity. The package comes with a central ```SpotifyService``` which is designed to act as a medium between Unity and Spotify. The package also comes with an example Spotify App built from the ground up using Unity UI and the Spotify4Unity service. For more information, check out the [Examples](#examples) section

Spotify4Unity v2.0 currently only supports Windows, Linux and Mac
